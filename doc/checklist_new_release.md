The following steps should be performed before releasing a new pycarl version.

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
   * To get all the commits from an author since the last tag execute:
   ```console
   git log last_tag..HEAD --author "author_name"
   ```
   * Set release month

2. Update used carl version:
   * Update `carl_min_version` in `setup.py`

3. Check that pycarl builds without errors and all tests are successful
   * [Github Actions](https://github.com/moves-rwth/pycarl/actions) should run successfully

4. Set new pycarl version:
   * Set new pycarl version in `lib/pycarl/_version.py`

5. Set new tag in git
   ```console
   git tag -a new_version
   git push origin new_version
   ```
   Next we push the tag to GitHub. This step requires the GitHub repo to to be configured as a remote.
   ```console
   git remote add github https://github.com/moves-rwth/pycarl.git
   git push github new_version
   ```
   The new tag should now be visible on [GitHub](https://github.com/moves-rwth/pycarl/tags)

6. [Add new release](https://github.com/moves-rwth/pycarl/releases/new) in GitHub.

7. Create new python package for release on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pycarl/):
   ```console
   python3 setup.py sdist
   python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine
   python3 -m twine upload dist/*
   ```
